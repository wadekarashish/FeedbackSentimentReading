The project is part of my miccrosoft ML learning. This project leverages the power of Microsoft.ML to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. It aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive or negative. This project demonstrates how to build a sentiment analysis model using Microsoft.ML's machine learning capabilities.

# Features
•	Data Preprocessing: Utilize Microsoft.ML's data processing capabilities to clean and prepare text data for sentiment analysis (this project uses sample data file yelp_labelled.txt).
•	Model Training: Train a sentiment analysis model using various algorithms available in Microsoft.ML, with Macro-accuracy and algorithms such as SDCA, L-BFGS, Lightgbm, Fast Tree, Fast Forest etc.
•	Model Evaluation: Macro-accuracy : 0.7743, Model : FastTreeOva .
